Today I set up my GitHub Repository.

## February 16th 2023 - Datasets Description 

I have uploaded two fan-made datasets related to the choose-your-own-adventure-style visual novel app Choices: Stories You Play. One of them contains the view counts and provided keywords for each story available in the Choices app. I copied it from the Choices Wiki Statistics page and pasted it into Excel so that I could save it as a .csv file. The other dataset contains the “diamond” costs for each Choices story. The diamond costs dataset was created by a fan and uploaded to the Choices subreddit (r/choices). I also copied it into an Excel sheet and saved it as a .csv file. 

Choices Wiki Statistics Dataset: https://choices-stories-you-play.fandom.com/wiki/Statistics 
The columns organizing the values in this dataset are “Book Name,” “Views,” and “Keywords.” There are 120 rows representing the 120 titles released in the app prior to 2023. On the Wiki webpage, one can choose whether they want to view the order of the values in the table by view count or alphabetically according to book name or keywords. The version that I copied to Excel and uploaded to GitHub is ordered by the number of views, with the first value being the book with the highest view count. The Choices app changed its UI in 2020 and no longer provides data on the number of views for stories, so the “views” column has not been updated since September 2nd, 2020, but it is likely the most accurate way to determine the popularity level of the stories released prior to that date. Additionally, the Wiki page states that it is unknown what gets counted as “views.” The views values were collected directly from the app, but it is unclear if it accounts for the number of times a chapter was started or completed, the number of players who completed the book, or whether replays are counted as unique views. Moreover, the “Book Name” and “Keywords” columns appear to be up-to-date as of December 2022 (although I have noticed at least one missing book, which began releasing weekly chapters in late November), but the dataset does not yet include any books from this year, so there are some gaps to fill. I also think the keywords would be helpful for expanding the dataset to group the titles further or categorize them based on genre.

Choices Diamond Costs Dataset: https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/ixskc4/to_save_or_not_to_save_diamonds_edition_no/ 
Every Choices story has exclusive scenes, character outfits and hairstyles, which cost “diamonds” to unlock. Players can purchase diamonds or receive them as rewards from reading new chapters, completing books, and watching ads. Using information from the Choices Wiki, a fan calculated the total number of diamond costs for each book and broke down the costs according to various categories. The columns in this dataset are “Book Title,” “Total Diamonds,” “Outfits With Effects,” “Outfits/Hair No Effect,” “LI’s With Effect,” “LI’s No Effect,” “Other With Effect,” and “Other No Effect.” “LI” means ‘love interest,’ referring to the characters with whom the main character can pursue romantic relationship routes if the player chooses. “With Effects” refers to stories with an approval rating that can affect the outcome of the story. Approval ratings may relate to relationships the player has forged with other characters depending on their choices or more general storyline approval that relates to another aspect of the plot. The books that had not finished releasing chapters at the time this dataset was made were left blank. This dataset was created two years ago and has not been updated since, so there are many values that could be added to the existing columns.
